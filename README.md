Continuing my progression through the Bandit challenges, this document details my completion of **Bandit Level 4**. This level further develops **file system skills** by requiring the use of the `file` command to **identify files based on their type**. This is a fundamental skill in system administration and security analysis for understanding and categorizing different data formats.

-----

## Challenge Overview: File Type Identification üö©

**OverTheWire Bandit** Level 4 builds upon previous file system navigation skills by introducing the concept of file types. The challenge requires using the `file` command to differentiate between various file types and locate a specific file type containing the password for the next level.

**Level 4 Objective:** In the `bandit4` user's home directory, there's a directory named `inhere`.  Within `inhere`, there are multiple files. Identify the one file that is of type "text" (ASCII text) and read its contents to obtain the password for Bandit Level 5.

-----

## ‚úÖ Steps to Complete Bandit Level 4

Here are the steps I took to successfully complete Bandit Level 4:

1.  **Establish SSH Connection to Bandit Level 4:** Log in to the Bandit server as user `bandit4`.  *(Password for `bandit4` is obtained from Bandit Level 3 - refer to Level 3 documentation.)*

    ```bash
    ssh bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
    ```

2.  **List Files and Directories in Home Directory (`ls -a` command):** Once logged in, I used `ls -a` to see all files and directories.  This revealed a directory named `inhere`.

    ```bash
    ls -a
    ```

3.  **Navigate to the `inhere` Directory (`cd inhere` command):** I used the `cd inhere` command to change my current directory to the `inhere` directory.

    ```bash
    cd inhere
    ```

4.  **List Files in `inhere` Directory (`ls -l` command):**  Inside the `inhere` directory, I used `ls -l` to get a detailed listing of all files. This showed files named `-file00`, `-file01`, ..., `-file09`.

    ```bash
    ls -l
    ```

5.  **Determine File Types (`file ./-file*` command):** To determine the type of each file, I used the `file` command with a wildcard `./-file*` to check all files starting with `-file`. The `./` is important to specify that the files are in the current directory due to the filenames starting with `-`.

    ```bash
    file ./-file*
    ```
    *(This command examines each file and outputs its file type.)*

6.  **Identify the "ASCII text" File:**  From the output of the `file` command, I scanned the results to identify the file that was reported as "ASCII text".  In this case, it was `-file07`.

7.  **Read the Password File (`cat ./-file07` command):**  Once I identified `-file07` as the ASCII text file, I used the `cat` command to read its contents.  Again, `./` is used before `-file07` because of the leading hyphen in the filename.

    ```bash
    cat ./-file07
    ```

8.  **Extract Bandit Level 5 Password:** The `cat` command displayed the password for Bandit Level 5, which I carefully noted.

9.  **Logout (Optional):** Used the `exit` command to close the SSH connection.

    ```bash
    exit
    ```

# üõ°Ô∏è OverTheWire Bandit CTF - Level 5: Efficient Password Hunting with `find` and `grep` üöÄ

## Mastering File Searching: Utilizing `find` and `grep` for Targeted Information Retrieval

Building upon previous file system and permission concepts, this document details my completion of **Bandit Level 5** using a more efficient command-line approach.  Instead of manually analyzing directory permissions, this solution leverages the powerful combination of the `find` and `grep` commands to **directly search for the password file based on its characteristics**, demonstrating advanced command-line efficiency.

-----

## Challenge Overview: Targeted File Search üö©

**OverTheWire Bandit** Level 5 can be solved by analyzing permissions, as documented previously. However, this revised solution showcases a more streamlined and powerful method using `find` and `grep`. This approach highlights the versatility of the Linux command-line for targeted information retrieval within complex file structures.

**Level 5 Objective:**  Within the `bandit5` user's home directory and its subdirectory `inhere`, locate a file that is *not executable*, has a *size of 1033 bytes*, and contains the string "ASCII text". Read the contents of this file to obtain the password for Bandit Level 6.

-----

## ‚úÖ Steps to Complete Bandit Level 5 (Using `find` and `grep`)

Here are the steps I took to efficiently complete Bandit Level 5 using `find` and `grep`:

1.  **Establish SSH Connection to Bandit Level 5:** Log in to the Bandit server as user `bandit5`.  *(Password for `bandit5` is obtained from Bandit Level 4 - refer to Level 4 documentation.)*

    ```bash
    ssh bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the `inhere` Directory (`cd inhere` command):**  Once logged in, I used `cd inhere` to move into the `inhere` directory, as the challenge specifies the files are located within this directory and its subdirectories.

    ```bash
    cd inhere
    ```

3.  **Utilize `find` and `grep` to Search for the Password File:**  This is the key step. I used a single, powerful command combining `find`, `exec`, `file`, and `grep` to search for the file meeting the criteria:

    ```bash
    find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable -exec file {} + | grep "ASCII text"
    ```

    Let's break down this command:
    *   `find .`:  Starts the `find` command, searching in the current directory (`.`) and its subdirectories.
    *   `-type f`:  Specifies to only look for files (not directories).
    *   `-size 1033c`:  Filters for files that are exactly 1033 bytes in size (`c` for bytes).
    *   `! -executable`:  Filters out executable files (files that are *not* executable).
    *   `-exec file {} +`:  For each file that matches the previous criteria, executes the `file` command to determine its file type.  `{}` is a placeholder for the found files, and `+` optimizes execution.
    *   `| grep "ASCII text"`:  Pipes the output of the `find ... -exec file ...` command to `grep`, which filters for lines containing "ASCII text".

4.  **Identify the Password File Path:** The output of the combined `find` and `grep` command directly revealed the path to the password file: `./maybehere07/.file2: ASCII text, with very long lines (1000)`. This tells us the file is `.file2` located in the `maybehere07` directory within the current directory (`inhere`).

5.  **Read the Password File (`cat` command):**  Used the `cat` command with the discovered file path to read the content of the password file:

    ```bash
    cat ./maybehere07/.file2
    ```

6.  **Extract Bandit Level 6 Password:** The `cat` command displayed the password for Bandit Level 6, which I carefully noted.

7.  **Logout (Optional):** Used the `exit` command to close the SSH connection.

    ```bash
    exit
    ```
